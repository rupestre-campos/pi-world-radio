## What is this?

A retro radio to tune-in to streaming stations from around the world.
A fork from original project intended to run with python on the terminal only.

##Installation
install mpv with

sudo apt install mpv

then python requirements with

python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

then run and have fun
python3 radio_cli.py


# How this started

The map was converted to mapbox.js only without the gl part for old systems.
Even like this it was too much for my old laptop to deal,
i decided to make a cli to run the music streams, and seems to work.
Still work in progress. Feedback welcome.
