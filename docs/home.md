# Introduction

This is the documentation on how I built the Raspberry Pi Retro World Radio.

## Inspiration

The original idea for this project came from this project on Hackaday -
[Raspberry Pi World Radio](https://hackaday.io/project/174631-raspberry-pi-world-radio ':target=_blank').
The author of that project never released any of the source code and there were
couple of posts on Reddit where people were wondering what would it take to build
something like this. I loved the concept and decided to take a shot at building one.

## The Build

The rest of the docs contains a mixture of detailed instructions and rough notes of
how I built the Retro Pi World radio. The docs and the project is still very much a
work in progress.

#### Questions/Comments

If you have any questions or need help, please open an
[issue](https://github.com/trustMeIAmANinja/pi-world-radio/issues/new ':target=_blank') and I will do my best to answer you.

#### Contributions

I don't claim to be an expert in JavaScript, HTML/CSS and as such there is room
for improvement in the App thats running on the Rapsberry Pi. I am happy to take in
contributions as PRs to the source code.
